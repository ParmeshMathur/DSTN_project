Question #3

The memory subsystem [with TLB, L1 Cache, L2 Cache and Main Memory] has following configuration:
TLB: Conventional Hierarchical TLB [8-way set associative L1 TLB with 16 entries [Random replacement] and 4-way set-associative L2 TLB with 32 entries [LRU square
matrix replacement]. Flushing of non-shared entries happen at context switching.].
L1 Cache: 4KB, 32B, 4 Way set associative way-halting cache. The cache follows Write back and Look through. It follows LRU counter as replacement policy.
L2 Cache: 32KB, 64B, 16 Way set associative cache. The cache follows Write through and look aside. It follows FIFO as replacement policy.
Main Memory with Memory Management: 32MB Main memory with Second Chance as replacement policy. The memory management scheme used is Pure Paging.
Thrashing mechanism to implement: Page fault frequency.

Given assumptions

1. Virtual Memory contains the complete program. Hard disk is big enough to hold all the programs and No network file is accessed.
2. First 2 blocks of the process (assume the page size and frame size same and is 512B) will be pre-paged into main memory before a process starts its execution.
3. All other pages are loaded on demand [Assume the system supports dynamic loading. Also assume that the system has no dynamic linking support].
4. Main memory follows Global replacement. Lower limit number of pages and upper limit number of pages per process should be strictly maintained.
5. Page tables [and segment tables wherever applicable] of all the processes reside in main memory and will not be loaded into cache memory levels.

Memory

Physical address = 25 bits
Frame offset = 9 bits
Frame number = (25 - 9) = 16 bits
Total number of frames: 2^(16) = 65536

Virtual address = 32 bits
Page offset = 9 bits
Page number = (32 - 9) = 23 bits
Total number of pages: 2^(23) = 8388608

L1 cache


L2 cache
512 lines are there. Each way has 16 lines. Therefore 32 ways are there.
The cache follows Write through and look aside. It follows FIFO as replacement policy.




TLB

L1 TLB 8-way set-associative L1 TLB with 16 entries 
L2 TLB 4-way set-associative L2 TLB with 32 entries

Each TLB entry consists of:
23-bit page no. (32-bit virtual address - 9-bit page offset)
16-bit frame no. (25-bit physical address - 9-bit frame offset)
1-bit valid/invalid bit
1-bit shared bit
